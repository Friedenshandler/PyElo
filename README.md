# PyElo
**PyElo** is a Python implementation of the Elo rating system. PyElo supports rating **1v1 matches** and **team versus team** matches. PyElo also supports rating **ranked matches** where players place in ordered positions (e.g., 1st place, 2nd place, 3rd place, and so on).

## 1v1 matches
In the Elo rating system, a win is worth **1 point**, a draw is worth **0.5 points**, and a loss is worth **0 points**. Consider a match between two players A and B with ratings `rating_a` and `rating_b`. To get the expected score of player A, use the `expected_score` function. To get the expected score of player B, reverse the arguments (`expected_score(rating_b, rating_a)`), or do `1 - expected_score(rating_a, rating_b)`.

```Python
# All arguments are ints or floats.
def expected_score(rating_a, rating_b)
```

Suppose that player A and player B have played a match, and player A scores `score` points. Use the `update_rating` function, which returns a tuple with the new ratings of both players:

```Python
# All arguments are ints or floats.
def update_rating(rating_a, rating_b, score, k_a=20, k_b=20):
```

`update_rating` allows you to set the *K* factor of player A and player B (`k_a` and `k_b`). The *K* factor is the maximum change in rating after a match. Higher values of *K* make ratings change more drastically per game.

```Python
>>> rating_a = 1500 # Rating of player A.
>>> rating_b = 1500 # Rating of player B.
>>> expected_score(rating_a, rating_b)
0.5
>>> score = 1 # Score of player A.
>>> update_rating(rating_a, rating_b, score)
(1510.0, 1490.0)
```

## Team versus team matches
A *team* is a group of players. Consider a match between two teams A and B. `team_a` and `team_b` are the list of each players' ratings in each team. To get the expected score of team A, use the `expected_team_score` function. To get the expected score of player B, reverse the arguments (`expected_team_score(team_b, team_b)`), or do `1 - expected_team_score(team_a, team_b)`.

```Python
# All arguments are lists of ints or floats.
def expected_team_score(team_a, team_b)
```

Suppose that team A and team B have played a match, and team A scores `score` points. Use the `update_rating` function, which returns a tuple with the new ratings of both teams in the given order:

```Python
# team_a and team_b are lists of ints or floats. score, k_a, and k_b are ints or floats.
def update_team_rating(team_a, team_b, score, k_a=20, k_b=20)
```

`update_team_rating` allows you to set the *K* factor of team A and team B (`k_a` and `k_b`).

```Python
>>> team_a = [1500, 1200] # Ratings of team A.
>>> team_b = [1300, 1400] # Rating of player B.
>>> expected_team_score(team_a, team_b)
0.5
>>> score = 1 # Score of team A.
>>> update_team_rating(team_a, team_b, score)
([1516.9804088557735, 1203.0195911442265], [1292.8012999960577, 1387.1987000039423])
```

## Ranked matches
A ranked match is where each player places in a specific position after the match, like 1st place, 2nd place, 3rd place, and so on. Consider a ranked match between two or more players. To get the expected placing of a player A against the opposing players, use the `expected_place` function.

```Python
# rating is an int or float, opponent_ratings is a list of ints or floats.
def expected_place(rating, opponent_ratings)
```

For example,
```Python
>>> rating = 1500 # Player rating.
>>> opponent_ratings = [1300, 1600, 1400]
>>> expected_place(rating, opponent_ratings) # Around 2nd or 3rd place.
2.240253073352042
```

Suppose that two or more players have played a ranked match, and their ratings are ordered in the `ranks` list. Use the `update_rank_rating` function, which returns a list of all updated ratings in the given order:

```Python
# ranks is a list of ints or floats, k is either an int or float or a list of ints or floats.
def update_rank_rating(ranks, k=20)
```

`update_rank_rating` allows you to set either a single *K* factor for all players, or a list of *K* factors for each player.

```Python
>>> ranks = [1500, 1400, 1450, 1300, 1400, 1600]
>>> update_rank_rating(ranks)
[1508.114899824563, 1407.3248401762253, 1451.7141475303665, 1302.3691294900568, 1395.3248401762253, 1585.1521428025628]
```

## Match fairness
Suppose that you wish to determine how "fair" a match between two players or two teams is. The `fairness` and `fairness_team` functions return the "fairness" of a match between two players or two teams between 0 and 1.

```Python
# All arguments are ints or floats.
def fairness(rating_a, rating_b)

# All arguments are lists of ints or floats.
def fairness_team(team_a, team_b)
```

## How team and ranked ratings work
The standard Elo system only handles 1v1 matches. However, PyElo abstracts the Elo system to team and ranked ratings. A team's total rating is the sum of its player's ratings, and the expected score is calculated based on this sum. To update the ratings, PyElo first computes the total change in rating for both teams. Then, each player's contribution to the team based on their rating is calculated using the Bradley-Terry rating scale.

Ranked ratings work by considering a ranked match as wins against the opponents who placed below the player and losses against the opponents who placed above the player. The normal Elo update equations are then applied.
